## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
They are using technology and algorithms to trade stocks at a quicker more efficient clip. They are disrupting the traditional manual traders, using technology to beat the market for better returns. In their code of ethics HRT goes into length about being a "conscientious market participant" that values and strives for fair and transparent markets. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
Hudson River Trading's customer are Investment Banks and Investment Firms. In 2018 HRT launched their Single Dealer Platform to provide access to their tech. There is no public number of customers but they do boast that they account for about 5% of all U.S. equity trades everyday. 
**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
They utilize machine learning and algorithms for trading. Not only does this help them make smarter and more accurate trades as far as strike prices but their algoriithms also allow for quicker trades that move in and out of positions to mitigate risk. This is going to be very different from the strategies of lecacy trading firms that rely on manual traders to input trades and watch the market constantly. 

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**
For their website and platform UI HRT uses php and Bootstrap. Their trading algorithms are created using python.

## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Hudson River Trading falls into the domain of Investment Management because they are a high frequency multi-asset quantitative trading firm. 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
Due to the digital transformation the domain is going through, Delloitte suggests that outsourcing tech and offshore approaches may increase. More investment firms are looking for partners like HRT rather than developing in house solutions. In the past 5-10 we have seen a major increase in the use of technology when tradding assets. Algorithms that are meant to beat the market are more commonplace. The innovation of using these alogrithms to trade has completely disrupted the Investment domain as more funding and resources are diverted to Fintech rather than legacy trading firms that will soon be seen as "old school."

* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**
Some other major players in the HFT (high frequency trading) space are Virtu Financial, Quantlab Financial and Jump Trading.

## Results:

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
There has been a massive business impact by HRT due to the size and volume of trading they do everyday. With HRT being responsible for about 5% of all U.S. trading volume everyday the impact is huge on the market and as well for other firms that want to mimic similar revenue or marketshare. Many HFT firms are also considered market makers which means they provide both the bid and ask for equity trades. 

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
Some core metrics in this domain would be performance of algorithms and how they compare to overall market growth. Another huge metric would be revenue, according to growjo.com HRT's annual revenue was estimated at about $65.6M. HRT is a leader in the high frequency trading space boasting massive marketshare and revenue numbers. 

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
Hudson River Trading is a leader in the domain. They recently, in 2018 bought a competitor in the space called Sun Trading. After HRT purchased Sun Trading they also invested 350 Million into a company called Blockfi which trades cryptocurrency. This purchase and investment is a big statement on their commitment to the future of the marriage between tech and finance. 

## Recommendations:

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
As far as offerings go Hudson River Trading is almost a one-stop-shop for institutional investors looking to get in on high frequency trading. As HFT trading is not econiomical for retail traders they do not have any resources for retail traders. One offering they could make for their customers could be News based algo trading or Social Media based algo trading similar to the ETF $BUZZ.

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
I think this offering would be profitable as people are utlizing social media and news stories to influence their stock purchases. Using the huge infrasturcture HRT already has they could easily implement this as a product that would differ from their normal HFT. 

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
The new solution of News based or Social Media based trading algos would be all created in house by the engineers they already have so the creation of the algos would not be taxing on infrastructure or labor. 

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
Creating the algorithm in house would be cost effective and already be something that the engineers look at every day. It would just be a slight shift in goals for that algo team.
